## About the app
Name of this app "Yata", yet another Todo app. But it's supposed to be "Yaha", yet another habit app. It will be eventually Yaha. Leaving that aside, the way it works is, you create something called "template" as in, habit template. Which repeats everyday. You check each one as you complete those "Todos" for that day.. and so on for each day.

You can always edit/update the template habit list based on your life goals.

Apart from these main features, there is another additional option to save your progress, meaning at the end of the day once you mark all the habits that you've completed, you may save the "progress", meaning, it stores your today's habit updates to its "history", so that in future when I add more features like some kind of reporting, that data can be initialized to see which habits are sticking and which habits you are still struggling with.. that'd be very helpful. And ALL data stays with you. There is no external database to this app. So, nobody can access your data other than from your phone directly.

## For development

node server.js
```

## Default text

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
